## Introduction

This project is visualization of given data in table view. The main objective was to use pure HTML/CSS.

## Setup

There is no prerequisite to run the project. Open `index.html` file in order to see the web page.

## Building process

The project is built based on a Figma file. The common semantic HTML and CSS style guidelines are followed through. The pixel-perfect approach is targeted, however there might be minor differences as font-family was not provided. I tried to find the most similiar-looking font-family.

## Conclusion

I enjoyed building the particular project and I hope I will get your feedback as soon as possible.
